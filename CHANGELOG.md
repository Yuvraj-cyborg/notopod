## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-11

First release. A working editor with live preview; no diagram language yet.

### Added

- Editor: typing, cursor movement (by character, word, line, page, note),
  undo/redo with word-level grouping, atomic save, save-as prompt,
  unsaved-changes guard on quit.
- Live preview: every block renders formatted except the one under the
  cursor, which shows raw Markdown. Lists switch per item. `Ctrl+P` turns
  the preview off.
- Enter continues bullet, numbered, task and quote lines; Enter on an
  empty item ends the list. Tab / Shift+Tab indent and outdent.
- Find: incremental, smart-case, wraps around (`Ctrl+F`, `Ctrl+G`).
- Rendering for headings, paragraphs, emphasis, strong, strikethrough,
  inline code, links, images, bullet and numbered lists, task lists,
  block quotes, pipe tables with alignment, fenced and indented code
  blocks, horizontal rules, HTML blocks and YAML front matter.
- `notopad render FILE` prints a formatted note to stdout, with ANSI
  colours when writing to a terminal (`--width`, `--no-color`, `NO_COLOR`).
- Workspace split into `notopad-core`, `notopad-render`,
  `notopad-editor`, `notopad-tui` and the `notopad` binary.
- Nix flake (`nix build`, `nix run`, `nix develop`).
- CI on Linux, macOS and Windows; tagged releases build binaries for five
  targets.
